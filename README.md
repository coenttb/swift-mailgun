### Configuration

#### [recommended] Configuration via Dependencies
```swift
import Mailgun

extension Mailgun.Client: @retroactive DependencyKey {
    public static var liveValue: Mailgun.AuthenticatedClient? {
        @Dependency(\.envVars) var envVars
        
        guard
            let baseURL = envVars.mailgun?.baseURL,
            let apiKey = envVars.mailgun?.apiKey,
            let domain = envVars.mailgun?.domain
        else {
            return nil
        }
        
        return Mailgun.Client.live(
            apiKey: apiKey,
            baseUrl: baseURL,
            domain: domain,
            session: { try await URLSession.shared.data(for: $0) }
        )
    }
}
```

Access the client via `Dependency(\.mailgunClient) var mailgunClient`.

    from: .init("sender@yourdomain.com"),

    subject: "Hello from Mailgun Swift SDK",
    html: "<h1>Hello!</h1><p>This is a test email.</p>",
    text: "Hello! This is a test email."
